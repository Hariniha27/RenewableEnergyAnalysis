# ðŸŒž Renewable Energy Production Log Analysis

## Overview
This mini-project focuses on analyzing renewable energy production logs (Solar, Wind, Hydro) using Python to extract meaningful insights on energy generation patterns.  

It aligns with **Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7): Affordable and Clean Energy**, which emphasizes ensuring access to **affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all**.

The project aims to:
- Understand trends and peak production times for renewable energy sources  
- Identify correlations between energy generation and environmental factors (temperature, wind speed)  
- Support data-driven decisions to optimize renewable energy utilization

---

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing and invalid values, formatting timestamps  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries and insights  
- **Visualizations**:
  - Total energy produced by each source (bar charts)  
  - Energy production trends over time (line charts)  
  - Relationship with environmental factors like temperature and wind speed (scatter plots)  
  - Correlation heatmap for key variables  
- **Key Insights**: Understanding which sources perform best under different conditions  

---

## SDG 7 Alignment
This project contributes to **SDG 7** by:
- Promoting **efficient use of renewable energy** through data analysis  
- Helping **optimize energy production** to reduce reliance on non-renewable sources  
- Supporting informed decision-making for **sustainable energy planning**
